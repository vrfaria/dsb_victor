# The Bechdel Test

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/

The [Bechdel test](https://bechdeltest.com) is a way to assess how women are depicted in Hollywood movies.  In order for a movie to pass the test:

1. It has to have at least two [named] women in it
2. Who talk to each other
3. About something besides a man

There is a nice article and analysis you can find here https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/
We have a sample of 1394 movies and we want to fit a model to predict whether a film passes the test or not.

```{r read_data}

bechdel <- read_csv(here::here("data", "bechdel.csv")) %>% 
  mutate(test = factor(test)) 
glimpse(bechdel)

```
How many films fail/pass the test, both as a number and as a %?

```{r}

#| label: problem-1

bechdel %>%
  group_by(test) %>% # groups the data by the test result
  summarize(qt_movies = n()) %>% # summarizes the data to get the quantity of movies in each category (pass/fail)
  mutate(perc_movies = qt_movies/sum(qt_movies)) # calculates the percentages in each category

```


## Movie scores
```{r}
ggplot(data = bechdel, aes(
  x = metascore,
  y = imdb_rating,
  colour = test
)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3, size = 3) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("tomato", "olivedrab")) +
  labs(
    x = "Metacritic score",
    y = "IMDB rating",
    colour = "Bechdel test"
  ) +
 theme_light()
```


# Split the data
```{r}
# **Split the data**

set.seed(123)

data_split <- initial_split(bechdel, # updated data
                           prop = 0.8, 
                           strata = test)

bechdel_train <- training(data_split) 
bechdel_test <- testing(data_split)
```

Check the counts and % (proportions) of the `test` variable in each set.
```{r}

#| label: problem-2

bechdel_train %>%
  group_by(test) %>% # groups the data by the test result
  summarize(qt_movies = n()) %>% # summarizes the data to get the quantity of movies in each category (pass/fail)
  mutate(perc_movies = qt_movies/sum(qt_movies)) # calculates the percentages in each category

bechdel_test %>%
  group_by(test) %>% # groups the data by the test result
  summarize(qt_movies = n()) %>% # summarizes the data to get the quantity of movies in each category (pass/fail)
  mutate(perc_movies = qt_movies/sum(qt_movies)) # calculates the percentages in each category

# in both cases, the % is close to each other and to the % in the complete dataset analyzed in Problem 1
```

## Feature exploration

## Any outliers? 

```{r}

bechdel %>% 
  select(test, budget_2013, domgross_2013, intgross_2013, imdb_rating, metascore) %>% 

    pivot_longer(cols = 2:6,
               names_to = "feature",
               values_to = "value") %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x=test, y = value, fill = test)+
  coord_flip()+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~feature, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(x=NULL,y = NULL)

# In each of the variables analyzed, there is a series of outliers as depicted by the dots in the boxplots, both for movies that passed the test and movies that failed the test. Regarding movies scores, Metacritics presents less outliers than IMBD. Overall, movies that failed the test have slightly higher averages in all metrics, but there is a very significant overlap in the interquartile distance if compared to movies that passed the test, so no conclusion can be drawn in whether movies that fail the test perform better.

```


## Scatterplot - Correlation Matrix

Write a paragraph discussing the output of the following 
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#| label: problem-3

bechdel %>% 
  select(test, budget_2013, domgross_2013, intgross_2013, imdb_rating, metascore)%>% 
  ggpairs(aes(colour=test), alpha=0.2)+
  theme_bw()

# The output report shows a few relevant descriptive statistics to understand our data, as follows:
#     - In the topmost row, we can see the boxplots just like in the previous plot, from which we can identify              outliers in each of the metrics
#     - In the leftmost column, we have a histogram for each of the metrics, and we observe very similar patterns           for both movies that failed the test and movies that passed the test
#     - In the main diagonal, we have probability density plots for each metric, where we can observe that the              curves for both movies that failed the test and movies that passed the test have a huge overlapping
#     - Bellow the main diagonal, we have scatter plots showing the relationship between the metrics two by two.            Symmetrically to the other side of the main diagonal, we have the correlation between the same two                  variables, that associate with the scatter plots. We can observe that domestic gross revenue and                    international gross revenue correlates very strongly with each other, correlates somehow with budget and            very slightly with scores (a little bit stronger with IMDB). However, movie scores are not correlated with          the budget. IMBD and Metacritic scores also have a high correlation. 

```

## Categorical variables

Write a paragraph discussing the output of the following 
```{r}

#| label: problem-4

bechdel %>% 
  group_by(genre, test) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))
  
 
bechdel %>% 
  group_by(rated, test) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))

# The first table shows the number and proportion of movies that failed to pass the test and movies that passed the   test by genre. From it, we can see that Action (70.7%), Animation (67.7%), Crime (62.2%), Documentary (100%),       Fantasy (66.7%), Mistery (75.0%) and Sci-Fi (100%) present proportions of movies that failed to pass the test much   higher than the average of the whole dataset. On the other hand, Thriller (100%), Musical (100%), Horror (67.7%)    and Comedy (57.3%) have significantly higher proportions of movies that passed the test than the average of the     whole dataset

# The second table does the same analysis for movies' ratings. From that perspective, movies with G (61.5%) and       NC-17 (83.3%) fail to pass the test much more often than the average, but both have very small samples. Most of     the more significant ratings are closer to the overall average, and PG-13 is the one that shows the lowest          percentage of movies that failled to pass the test (52.9%)

```

# Train first models. `test ~ metascore + imdb_rating`

```{r}
lr_mod <- logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine(engine = "glm") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

lr_mod


tree_mod <- decision_tree() %>% 
  set_engine(engine = "C5.0") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

tree_mod 
```

```{r}


lr_fit <- lr_mod %>% # parsnip model
  fit(test ~ metascore + imdb_rating, # a formula
    data = bechdel_train # dataframe
  )

tree_fit <- tree_mod %>% # parsnip model
  fit(test ~ metascore + imdb_rating, # a formula
    data = bechdel_train # dataframe
  )
```

## Logistic regression

```{r}
lr_fit %>%
  broom::tidy()

lr_preds <- lr_fit %>%
  augment(new_data = bechdel_train) %>%
  mutate(.pred_match = if_else(test == .pred_class, 1, 0))

```

### Confusion matrix

```{r}
lr_preds %>% 
  conf_mat(truth = test, estimate = .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")


```


## Decision Tree
```{r}
tree_preds <- tree_fit %>%
  augment(new_data = bechdel) %>%
  mutate(.pred_match = if_else(test == .pred_class, 1, 0)) 


```

```{r}
tree_preds %>% 
  conf_mat(truth = test, estimate = .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

## Draw the decision tree

```{r}
draw_tree <- 
    rpart::rpart(
        test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
        data = bechdel_train, # uses data that contains both birth weight and `low`
        control = rpart::rpart.control(maxdepth = 5, cp = 0, minsplit = 10)
    ) %>% 
    partykit::as.party()
plot(draw_tree)

```

# Cross Validation

Run the code below. What does it return?

```{r}

#| label: problem-5

set.seed(123)
bechdel_folds <- vfold_cv(data = bechdel_train, 
                          v = 10, 
                          strata = test)
bechdel_folds

# The code creates 10 folds with slices of the dataset to potentially be used in a cross-validation method in the     sequence

```

## `fit_resamples()`

Trains and tests a resampled model.

```{r}
lr_fit <- lr_mod %>%
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
    resamples = bechdel_folds
  )


tree_fit <- tree_mod %>%
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
    resamples = bechdel_folds
  )
```


## `collect_metrics()`

Unnest the metrics column from a tidymodels `fit_resamples()`
```{r}

collect_metrics(lr_fit)
collect_metrics(tree_fit)


```


```{r}
tree_preds <- tree_mod %>% 
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating, 
    resamples = bechdel_folds,
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE) #<<
  )

# What does the data for ROC look like?
tree_preds %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  roc_curve(truth = test, .pred_Fail)  

# Draw the ROC
tree_preds %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  roc_curve(truth = test, .pred_Fail) %>% 
  autoplot()

```


# Build a better training set with `recipes`

## Preprocessing options

- Encode categorical predictors
- Center and scale variables
- Handle class imbalance
- Impute missing data
- Perform dimensionality reduction 
- ... ...

## To build a recipe

1. Start the `recipe()`
1. Define the variables involved
1. Describe **prep**rocessing [step-by-step]

## Collapse Some Categorical Levels

Do we have any `genre` with few observations?  Assign genres that have less than 3% to a new category 'Other'


```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
bechdel %>% 
  count(genre) %>% 
  mutate(genre = fct_reorder(genre, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = genre, 
             y = n)) +
  geom_col(alpha = .8) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = NULL) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = (nrow(bechdel_train)*.03), lty = 3)+
  theme_light()
```


```{r}
movie_rec <-
  recipe(test ~ .,
         data = bechdel_train) %>%
  
  # Genres with less than 5% will be in a catewgory 'Other'
    step_other(genre, threshold = .03) 
```
  

## Before recipe

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
bechdel_train %>% 
  count(genre, sort = TRUE)
```


## After recipe

```{r}
movie_rec %>% 
  prep() %>% 
  bake(new_data = bechdel_train) %>% 
  count(genre, sort = TRUE)
```

## `step_dummy()`

Converts nominal data into numeric dummy variables

```{r}
#| results = "hide"
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) 

movie_rec 
```

## Let's think about the modelling 

What if there were no films with `rated` NC-17 in the training data?

-  Will the model have a coefficient for `rated` NC-17?
-  What will happen if the test data includes a film with `rated` NC-17?

## `step_novel()`

Adds a catch-all level to a factor for any new values not encountered in model training, which lets R intelligently predict new levels in the test set.

```{r}

movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal_predictors) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) 

```


## `step_zv()`

Intelligently handles zero variance variables (variables that contain only a single value)

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) 
  
```


## `step_normalize()`

Centers then scales numeric variable (mean = 0, sd = 1)

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes())  %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric()) 

```


## `step_corr()`

Removes highly correlated variables

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes())  %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric()) %>% 
  step_corr(all_predictors(), threshold = 0.75, method = "spearman") 



movie_rec
```


# Define different models to fit

```{r}
## Model Building

# 1. Pick a `model type`
# 2. set the `engine`
# 3. Set the `mode`: regression or classification

# Logistic regression
log_spec <-  logistic_reg() %>%  # model type
  set_engine(engine = "glm") %>%  # model engine
  set_mode("classification") # model mode

# Show your model specification
log_spec

# Decision Tree
tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine(engine = "C5.0") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

tree_spec

# Random Forest
library(ranger)

rf_spec <- 
  rand_forest() %>% 
  set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")


# Boosted tree (XGBoost)
library(xgboost)

xgb_spec <- 
  boost_tree() %>% 
  set_engine("xgboost") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") 

# K-nearest neighbour (k-NN)
knn_spec <- 
  nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 4) %>% # we can adjust the number of neighbors 
  set_engine("kknn") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") 
```


# Bundle recipe and model with `workflows`


```{r}
log_wflow <- # new workflow object
 workflow() %>% # use workflow function
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>%   # use the new recipe
 add_model(log_spec)   # add your model spec

# show object
log_wflow


## A few more workflows

tree_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(tree_spec) 

rf_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(rf_spec) 

xgb_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(xgb_spec)

knn_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(knn_spec)

```

HEADS UP

1. How many models have you specified?
2. What's the difference between a model specification and a workflow?
3. Do you need to add a formula (e.g., `test ~ .`)  if you have a recipe?


# Model Comparison

You now have all your models. Adapt the code from slides `code-from-slides-CA-housing.R`, line 400 onwards to assess which model gives you the best classification.

# Rubric

13/13: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
